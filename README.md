## :thinking: What's This
Welcome to LLM Riddles! This is a game of wits and courage with language models. In the game, you need to construct questions that interact with the language model to get answers that meet the requirements. In this process, you can use your brain and use all the methods you can think of to get the model to output the results required by the answer.

## :technologist: Why Doing This

Our goal is to use this game to give participants a deeper understanding of the fascinating aspects of prompt engineering and natural language processing. This process will show players how to cleverly construct prompts and how to use them to trigger surprising responses from artificial intelligence systems, while also helping them better understand the incredible power of deep learning and natural language processing technologies. .
